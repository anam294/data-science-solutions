    "Fit a Logistic Regression Model with is_bad_reputation as target, and Overall as the only variable. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "1.\tWhat are values of beta0 (intercept) and beta1 (slope)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:**\n",
    "    - $\\beta_0$:   32.706152, $\\beta_1$:   -0.424407. The variable Overall is significant.\n",

    "# Questions - Possion Regression:\n",
    "We are interested in how many positions a player can compete in a good club. We define the “competence” of a player in a certain position if the player’s score in this position is above 75. \n",
    "For example, the famous Portuguese player Pepe (Id=120533) is competent in 3 positions: \n",
    "LCB, CB and RCB. The list of all positions is: \n",
    "LS, ST, RS, LW, LF, CF, RF, RW, LAM, CAM, RAM, LM, LCM, CM, RCM, RM, LWB, LDM, CDM, RDM, RWB, LB, LCB, CB, RCB, RB.\n",
    "The position_countis defined as total number of positions a player iscompetent in. Although this count is limited by 26, we will still treat it as Poisson distributed for the purpose of practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, please first conduct these steps to clean the data:\n",
    "1. Remove the players with International.Reputation = 1\n",
    "2. Remove goalkeepers and players with unknown players, i.e. remove the rows with position = NA or ‘GK’.\n",
    "3. Define position_count as above. \n",
    "When parsing the scores, please only include the score before the plus sign. For example, for score 75+3, it is used as 75, and therefore not considered as a competent score.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Fit a GLM model with 'BallControl' (let's call it model 1). How to explain these coefficients (intercept and slope)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:**\n",
    "    1. $\\beta_0 = -8.518$, $\\beta_1 = 0.129$. The variable BallControl is significant\n",
    "    1. Intercept: For BallControl = 0, the predicted number of positions the player can play in a top club is $\\exp(\\beta_0) = 0.002$\n",
    "    1. Slope: For every one unit the BallControl skill improves, the number of positions will be $\\exp(\\beta_1) = 1.138$ times of the number of positions before the improvement.\n",
    "1. Add 'Reaction' into the model (and call it model 2). What does the coefficients mean at this time?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:**\n",
    "    1. Same meaning for $\\beta_0$\n",
    "    1. Slopes: Given all other features (Reactions) unchanged, one unit of change of BallControl will cause the prediction to become $\\exp(0.07)=1.07$ times of that before the change.\n",
    "1. Diagnose the model2 by producing the four plots:\n",
    "    - Residuals vs Fitted, which draws a scatterplot of fitted values against residuals, with a regression line showing any apparent trend\n",
    "    -Normal Q-Q, which plots the standardized (z-score) residuals against the theoretical normal quantiles.\n",
    "    - Scale-Location, which scatter plots absolute square-rooted normalized residuals and fitted values, with a regression line. \n",
    "    - Residuals Vs Leverage, which shows if any outliers have influence over the regression fit. Anything outside the group and outside “Cook’s Distance” lines, may have an influential effect on model fit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Is there any problem in model diagnose for model 2? Who are the leverage points? \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:**\n",
    "    1. Outliers exist in residual plot, QQ plot and leverage plot\n",
    "    1. Case 1, 2 and 3 are leverage points\n",
    "    1. These are top players and model does not work well for them as for other players\n",
    "1. Remove the top 3 players: Messi, Ronaldo and Neymar. Refit model 1 & 2. What do you find this time?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:**\n",
    "    1. Outliers and influential points problems are mitigated, although there are still some potential leverage points.\n",
